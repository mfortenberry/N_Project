#NOOREST Solutions

#Project prepared by Nejat D

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and MERN stack. It is about building a remote tech team that can be a great way to access top talent from around the world. To build an effective remote tech team, it's important to establish clear communication channels and expectations from the outset. Utilizing collaboration tools, such as video conferencing, instant messaging, and project management software, can help keep your team connected and on the same page. Additionally, it's important to establish regular check-ins and meetings to ensure that everyone is up to speed on the team's progress and any issues or concerns are addressed in a timely manner.
